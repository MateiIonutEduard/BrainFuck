This smaller compiler provides complete Turing machine, so every Brainfuck program can run complex task.
I built the original Brainfuck compiler based on the Brainfuck compiler  released in 1993 by Urban Müller.
The application provides interpret of the Brainfuck scripts, that include the compile of the programs, build and run these scripts as executables.
The compiler consists  only 8 instructions: ,><+-[].
