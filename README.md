## Description
This smaller compiler provides complete Turing machine, so every Brainfuck program can run complex task. <br>
I built the original Brainfuck compiler based on the Brainfuck compiler  released in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. <br>
The application provides interpret of the Brainfuck scripts, that include the compile of the programs, <br> build and run these scripts as executables. <br> The compiler consists  only 8 instructions: <br>
```
,. for I/O
>< to increment/decrement memory pointer 
+- increment/decrement value of memory pointer
[] while loop statement 
```
